[01:23.12] Y'all know there's a lot of M C's
[01:24.03] But just give my chance on the mic
[01:26.78] Open the, open the, open the
[01:28.57] Open the, open the, open the, aah
[01:31.35] Open the safe with no key, it's easier than battlin' me
[01:34.09] 'Cause uh, uh, I'll make you walk like a doggy
[01:36.73] Some say on and on but they mean on, on
[01:38.57] I got tired of that new style, breakdown
[01:42.16] I have to take it back to the break of dawn
[01:43.95] When Melle Mel was Melle Mel
[01:45.73] And Al Capone was Al Capone
[01:47.55] Bootleg is sellin' now it's rap
[01:48.44] That's sellin' in the village but I'm just privileged
[01:50.20] To makin' my home from my spirit
[01:52.96] So when you hear me it's the man
[01:53.87] With the deeper thoughts
[01:54.71] At night I can't sleep my brain
[01:55.78] Keep movin' like a body on a horse
[01:56.65] I don't stand, don't stand
[01:58.41] Don't wife me I construct on bricks
[01:59.33] Some thoughts it wasn't
[02:01.11] Until he said, â€½He sunk my battleshipâ€
[02:02.07] So hip-hip, load the clip, hip, I miss, damn
[02:03.89] I pay my taxes so I won't mess with Sam
[02:08.39] Ya hear the rhyme, you stand still, some ask for refill
[02:10.19] We move your thoughts so I can see if you for fake or real
[02:11.92] 'Cause Buffalo Bill bit battle inside from my rap meal
[02:14.64] And left me on a hill, hill so when I battle no will
[02:17.48] So mama should I kill a man like Cypress Hill, chill
[02:20.15] I got no lawyer so I pleadin' my own appeal
[02:22.84] How does it feel when a monkey is your ill
[02:24.60] In a J A I L? I have no time to make bail
[02:27.39] Saw someone to be macho
[02:29.13] Like fritches that got the lyro
[02:30.08] So they had it at bein' a heroes
[02:30.96] Where did their bodies go, only God knows
[02:32.72] You got caught, between the fire and the hoses
[02:34.51] You wanna battle? Bring your Moses
[02:36.42] Forget what fun, what time Moses and someone goin' down
[02:39.19] And it ain't Gastor Douglass 'cause the roughest with the guy
[02:41.87] Becomes a pussy so all the bad boy talk
[02:44.55] Come on 'cause I'm the nice dog, yeah, hawk
[02:46.34] Throw many fights in fought courts, boss
[02:47.21] Never lost so toss a nickel and change your course
[02:49.95] Say, "Mama", say, "Mama", say, "Mama", say, "What?"
[02:53.60] Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
[02:57.28] 'Cause we were far, from reality
[03:02.66] Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
[03:07.18] 'Cause we were far, from reality
[03:12.54] Aiyyo, huh, huh, ho, with the badder that run the Tent
[03:15.28] Who walks really for lack of listenin' to the drum set
[03:18.82] You silly nimble bad as to my car, don't put the bass
[03:20.75] Oh, on the table test the super lantra, you got caught all that toe
[03:22.56] With twenty-thousand legs, I'm laughin' arrogantly
[03:25.21] As your nostril bleeds, relax and max and drink a Gin on the Tech
[03:29.75] Well their gatin' for another Pirate to lose his neck, check
[03:33.35] I got a call from Captain Hook in so quick
[03:37.83] We used to be partners 'fore the clip stole my rapper
[03:38.78] I had to be right 'cause you fight like it was a bitch
[03:40.54] I had to change the rhythmic pattern
[03:43.29] And make sure it fit so now when I go and see with she
[03:44.12] I thought the pirates through a telescope
[03:46.94] And bomb 'em like it's make believe
[03:47.88] Blow me my sword, I out for my protection
[03:50.55] 'Cause I might ship on landin' side and start an insurrection
[03:53.23] A pirate had disguised himself as one of my crew
[03:55.03] But I saw true and had to shake a him before he got through
[03:57.78] Hey, hey, guy the loot the booty
[03:59.55] I formed like a ram, I gave an ultimatum
[04:01.35] And told him he could do time
[04:03.17] But he argued and fought me
[04:04.02] He tried to bust right and so I took it upon myself
[04:05.81] To make the brother walk the plank
[04:08.61] Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
[04:12.24] 'Cause we were far, from reality
[04:18.56] Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
[04:22.12] 'Cause we were far, from reality
[04:38.42] Fo' to the fo' to the fi fe come, I smell the blood of
[04:41.13] An Englishman run son, ya, see the man cannot understand
[04:43.82] The hammer and the barrel hum, so when I get them someone
[04:46.57] Will know where the hell I'm from
[04:48.32] 'Cause I'm sprayin' M C's
[04:50.13] With my mack ten machine gun, the hand that rocks will
[04:52.83] Be the hand of the gun bum, rum, pum, pum, pum, pum
[04:55.68] Is the drop of my snare drum, freakin' is the beat of my tum, tum
[04:56.55] Makin' M C's walk like a doggy, hah, hah
[04:58.39] I'll make them walk like a doggy, it's like the blunt to the phillie
[05:01.94] The ganja to the sessy, you can't write a rhyme
[05:08.29] Without the roots mentality
[05:09.17] 'Cause ain't no Milli, Vanilli but the kiddy with the skilly
[05:10.08] To rhyme so dope, I made up my own vocabulaby, skilly
[05:12.79] Missed it from a bomber tacky lackin' all the bum
[05:13.60] That get her to a to and fro, I guess they made me boy
[05:15.53] So can I get the cheers, not the chant from cheers
[05:17.37] But the chant from my peers
[05:22.76] That I know are really down with me, cheers
[05:24.57] Now that I mean those that been since the beginnin'
[05:26.32] 'Cause some of y'all cut out when it started rainin'
[05:29.94] Now check me at the movies, I'm rollin' like Black Man
[05:30.82] I didn't need Batman, he teamed up with the favourite, eh
[05:34.47] Tell all your friend, friend, watch all your friend, friend
[05:36.21] 'Cause some say are your friend before wanna dem bring you poison
[05:39.05] So I roll by myself and that I carry my bit
[05:41.78] You wished you stayed around, you know my clip got the lip
[05:44.43] So empty your hooray, your hooray to your hip
[05:47.19] And if your hip's a book, you know you got to get off bricks man
[05:49.85] Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
[05:53.46] 'Cause we were far, from reality
[06:01.51] Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
[06:03.38] 'Cause we were far, from reality
